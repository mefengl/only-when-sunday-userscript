üèñÔ∏è The "Only When Sunday" UserScript is a JavaScript-based browser automation tool that closes specific websites tabs except on Sunday.

## Usage

The script currently targets the following websites:

- `twitter.com`
- `weibo.com`
- `youtube.com`
- `outlook.live.com`
- `spotify.com`
- `bilibili.com`
- `discord.com`
- ...

If you visit any of these sites on a day other than Sunday, the tab will be closed automatically.

## Customization

This script is created for personal use, but you can easily modify it to suit your own needs:

- **Target websites**: Modify the `websitesToClose` array in the script to include the websites you want to be closed automatically. Just replace or add the desired URLs to the array.
